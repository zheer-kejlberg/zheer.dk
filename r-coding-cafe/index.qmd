Welcome to the Coding Café at the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA).

We're a bi-weekly open “café” for anyone working at SDCA, Aarhus University Hospital, Department of Public Health, Department of Clinical Medicine and Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University to go and get assistance with coding in R. The only prerequisite so far is that you have had some type of introduction to R, preferably through a course such as <a href="https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/">this</a> offered by the Danish Diabetes and Endocrinology Academy or similar introductory courses.

The sessions are open and anyone can join in and out at anytime during the allotted time. There will be a 10-15 minue presentation at the beginning, tackling a concept in R or specific packages and workflows that are nice to know, and 1-2 experience instructors will subsequently help with specific challenges and questions. We also highly encourage the participants to interact with each other - maybe there is someone in the group that has the solution to your problem.

The latest schedule will always be on this website.

### Other planned themes are:

- Nice to know packages (e.g., {gtsummary} {Epi} {Hmisc})
- Matching and Weighting (using MatchIt and WeightIt)
- Missing data: different options and packages for it, including combining MICE with MatchThem/WeightThem
- Preregistration as a means to improved workflows in R
