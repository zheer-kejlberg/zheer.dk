We aimed to investigate the risk of major osteoporotic fractures (MOF) -- i.e., hip, vertebral, humerus, and forearm fractures -- with SGLT2 inhibitors compared to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when either is used in combination with metformin.Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using discharge diagnosis codes from the Danish National Patient Registry and data on all redeemed drug prescriptions from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Subjects treated with metformin in combination with either SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists between 2012 and 2018 were identified. Subjects were then propensity-score matched 1:1 based on age, sex, and index date. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. A Cox proportional hazards model was utilized to estimate crude and adjusted hazard rate ratios (HR) for MOF. Finally, Aalen's Additive Regression (AAR) model was used to examine a possible additive rather than multiplicative effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on fracture hazard while allowing time-varying covariate effects.Results: We identified 27,543 individuals treated with either combination. After matching, 18,390 individuals were included in the main analysis (9,190 in each group). Median follow-up times were 355 [interquartile range (IQR) 126-780] and 372 [IQR 136-766] days in the SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 receptor agonist group, respectively. The crude HR for MOPF was 0.77 [95\% CI 0.56-1.04] with SGLT2 inhibitors compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists. The fully adjusted model yielded an unaltered HR of 0.77 [95\% CI 0.56-1.05]. Results were similar across subgroup- and sensitivity analyses. Similarly, the multivariate AAR model yielded a non-significant difference between the two exposure groups.Conclusion: These results suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors have no effect on fracture risk when compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Cafestol, a bioactive compound in coffee, has demonstrated glucose-lowering and insulin-secretory properties in cell and animal studies. The acute effects of cafestol on glucose metabolism in humans have only been briefly investigated, and longer-term effects have not been explored. This study aimed to assess the effects of purified cafestol on insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters in healthy individuals with increased waist circumference at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Methods: A 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial was conducted with 40 participants. Insulin suppression tests, mixed meal tests, and MRI scans were performed before and after the intervention. Results: Administering 6 mg of cafestol twice daily did not alter insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance but led to significant reductions in body weight (2\%), visceral fat volume (5\%), and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (15\%) compared to the placebo. Conclusions: Cafestol may hold promise for weight and visceral fat reduction. Cafestol did not improve insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance in this study but might still contribute to the observed inverse association between coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes. Future research should explore higher dosages and longer treatment durations, particularly in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes.},

Methods A cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum database was conducted. All patients aged 18 years and older with a first-ever prescription for a DPP-4 inhibitor or an SGLT2 inhibitor as add-on to metformin between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2020 were selected. Patients starting with SGLT2 inhibitors were matched (up to 1:3) on propensity scores to patients starting with DPP-4 inhibitors. Propensity scores were calculated based on sex, age, body mass index, comorbidities, comedication and lifestyle factors. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the risk of fracture with SGLT2 inhibitor use as compared to DPP-4 inhibitor use. Results A total of 13 807 SGLT2 inhibitor users (age 55.4 {\textpm} 10.6 years, 36.7\% female) were included in this study, matched with 28 524 DPP-4 inhibitor users (age 55.4 {\textpm} 8.0 years, 36.4\% female). The risk of any fracture with current SGLT2 inhibitor use was similar compared with current DPP-4 inhibitor use (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.09, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.31), as was the risk of MOFs (aHR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.64-1.22) and the risk of fractures at any of the individual MOF sites. Additionally, no association was found with duration of SGLT2 inhibitor use (longest duration {$>$}811 days) for any of the individual SGLT2 inhibitor agents, or after stratification by sex and age. Conclusion Use of SGLT2 inhibitors was not associated with the risk of any fracture, MOFs or fracture at the individual MOF sites when compared to DPP-4 inhibitor use.},
