My full CV below will be updated occasionally. If you're wondering about the strange way of sectioning the CV, it follows from the Danish Health and Medicines Authority's definition of <a href="https://www.sst.dk/en/news/2013/~/media/39d3e216bcbf4a9096b286ee44f03691.ashx">the seven roles of physicians</a>. These are now commonly how physicians are assessed in our routine evaluations and in job applications. My academic CV tends to be structured differently.
