I am a physician-researcher from Denmark interested in (pharmaco)epidemiology and endocrinology. 

## Education
  
I have an MD from Aarhus University and a PhD within diabetes (pharmaco)epidemiology from Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA) and Aarhus University.

## Clinical work

My clinical experience spans endocrinology and internal medicine, emergency medicine, general/family medicine, and psychiatry.
I am currently employed as a part-time postdoc at SDCA while working 3 days a week in a general practice in Marselisborg, Aarhus, DK.

## Methodological experience

I have worked with various statistical, ML and causal inference methodologies and have a keen interest in the methodological aspect of the work. I am always happy to aid in methods discussions where I can.

I have previously worked with linear regression type models and tests, mixed effects models, survival models (Cox, Aalen's additive regression, Royston-Parmar / flexible parametric models), nonlinear methods (cubic splines, polynomial regression), imputation (MICE), propensity score methods (matching, IPW and SMR weighting), (causal) mediation analysis, clinical trials (vanilla, stepped-wedge), and common clustering and prediction type models. 

Currently, I am trying to be more Bayesian by (slowly but surely) working my way through Richard McElreath's <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/">Statistical Rethinking</a>.

## R packages

I am trying to be more reproducible. I have plans for implementing useful parts of my code in open-source packages (at least on GitHub).

Currently, I have two packages out:

- <a href="https://github.com/zheer-kejlberg/publistR">{publistR}</a>: an R package to easily create a structured and formatted list of your publications (example <a href="https://zheer.dk/cv/publications.html">here</a>)

- <a href="https://github.com/zheer-kejlberg/Z.gtsummary.addons">{Z.gtsummary.addons}</a>: an couple of functions to add to the great <a href="https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/">{gtsummary}</a> package.
