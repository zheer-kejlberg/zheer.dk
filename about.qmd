{{< iconify healthicons:doctor-male title='clinical' width=30px >}}
My clinical experience spans endocrinology and internal medicine, emergency medicine, general/family medicine, and psychiatry.
I am currently employed as a part-time postdoc at SDCA while working 3 days a week in a general practice in Marselisborg, Aarhus, DK.

## Methodological experience

I have worked with various statistical and causal inference methodologies and have a keen methodological interest. I am always happy to aid in methods discussions where I can.

{{< iconify ph:chart-scatter-light title='stats' width=30px >}}
I have experience with most foundational statistical methods and frameworks and have worked extensively with survival and nonlinear models, missing data, propensity score-based methods, mediation, moderation, RCT design, and more.

Currently, I am trying to be more Bayesian by (slowly but surely) working my way through Richard McElreath's <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/">Statistical Rethinking</a>.
