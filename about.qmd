I am a physician-researcher from Denmark interested in (pharmaco)epidemiology and endocrinology. 
\
\

## Education
  
MD from Aarhus University.   
PhD within diabetes (pharmaco)epidemiology from Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA) and Aarhus University.
\
\

## Clinical work

{{< iconify healthicons:doctor-male title='clinical' width=30px >}}
My clinical experience spans endocrinology and internal medicine, emergency medicine, general/family medicine, and psychiatry.
I am currently employed as a part-time postdoc at SDCA while working 3 days a week in a general practice in Marselisborg, Aarhus, DK.

## Methodological experience

I have worked with various statistical and causal inference methodologies and have a keen methodological interest. I am always happy to aid in methods discussions where I can.

{{< iconify ph:chart-scatter-light title='stats' width=30px >}}
I have experience with most foundational statistical methods and frameworks and have worked extensively with survival and nonlinear models, missing data, propensity score-based methods, mediation, moderation, RCT design, and more.

Currently, I am trying to be more Bayesian by (slowly but surely) working my way through Richard McElreath's <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/">Statistical Rethinking</a>.

## R packages

I have plans to be more reproducible and open sciency. In the coming years, my code will be published as R packages where it may be useful to others.

Currently, I have two minor packages out:

{{< iconify ph:list-bullets-thin title='publistR' width=30px >}}
<a href="https://github.com/zheer-kejlberg/publistR">{publistR}</a>:   
an R package to easily create a structured and formatted list of your publications (example <a href="https://zheer.dk/cv/publications.html">here</a>)

{{< iconify ph:table-thin title='Z.gtsummary.addons' width=30px >}}
<a href="https://github.com/zheer-kejlberg/Z.gtsummary.addons">{Z.gtsummary.addons}</a>:  
a couple of functions to add to the great <a href="https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/">{gtsummary}</a> package.
