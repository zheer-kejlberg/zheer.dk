The only prerequisite so far is that you have had some type of introduction to R, preferably through a course such as this offered by the Danish Diabetes and Endocrinology Academy or similar introductory courses.\nThe sessions are open and anyone can join in and out at anytime during the allotted time. There will be a 10-15 minue presentation at the beginning, tackling a concept in R or specific packages and workflows that are nice to know, and 1-2 experience instructors will subsequently help with specific challenges and questions. We also highly encourage the participants to interact with each other - maybe there is someone in the group that has the solution to your problem.\nThe latest schedule will always be on this website.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Upcoming dates, times, locations, and lesson subjects for the Café sessions.
